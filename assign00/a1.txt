A1:

a) The name of the manual is MC9S12DP256B Device User Guide V02.14

b) Intrupts found in Section 5 "Resets and Interrupts"
   Analog-Digital Converters found in Section 9
   Pulse-Width Modulation found in Section 14

c) The Ram Located beneath 256K byte flash EEPROM top left part and it has 12k byte of RAM, and it starts on $1000 address up to $3FFF and that is 12288 bytes

d)Pin number VDDA 83 and Pin Number 86 VSSA.  HOWEVER, on the Block Diagram there is 2 A/C pins connected to ATD1 and they are connected to ATD0
  SCI have two blocks SCI0 and SCI1
  SPI have three blocks SPI0, SPI1, SPI2

e) Pin 1 have the following assiggned signals : SS1/PWM3/KWP3/PP3
   When a pin has more than one signal it means the processor can be intrupted by different drivers from same pin. However since every driver will have different vector address ,so it dose not matter if one driver or more connected to that pin as long they maintain different vector addresses.
   XIRQ is on pin PE0
   the signal is barred means it is running on low voltage  (Bar/XIRQ)
   
A2:

a) oprx16 is a notation for Any integer in the range -32768 to +65535,  the addressing mode is IDX2 effective address and 16-bit signed offset from X,Y,SP, or PC;2.




ASSUME: X address is $0000
b) LDAA #$1E means LOAD value of #$1E into A IMMEDIATE ADDRESSING MODE  86 1E
   STAA 0,X means Store Accumulator A to Memory [x+0]  INDEXED A6 00
   LDAA #$78 means LOAD value #$78 into A   IMMEDIATE ADDRESSING MODE 86 78
   STAA 1,x means Store Accumulator A to Memory [x+1] INDEXED A6 01
   LDY 0,X it loads [X+0] Index Register into Y , here Y will contain (1E78) INDEXED ED 00
   
 c) the value for Y is 1E78 
 
 d) $800 = 1e hex , $801 = 78 hex
 
 e) the Program inserted is still there but ! the value in X as register still $800 but the value of $800 and $801 being reseted to the default value by the simulator
